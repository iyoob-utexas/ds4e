This University of Texas course teaches Data Science through Experiential Learning.  Students work with data sets from day one and progressively gain Data Science skills as they learn from their mistakes.


## About the course

This course provides students with the knowledge to analyze and interpret data sets using industry-standard methodology. Key skills include learning how to clean, visualize, and perform industry-specific analysis on large data sets.  Using predictive analysis and machine learning, students will build models to make defensible connections in the data. Upon finishing this model, students will verify/validate their hypothesis and conclusions. The course culminates in the creation of an interactive dashboard presenting the given correlations. By “telling the story” of their journey through the data, students will relay the skills they learned to their peers.
